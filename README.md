Title: Plant Disease Detection with YOLOv8 and Segment Anything Model

Description:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our innovative project on plant disease detection in crop fields using advanced techniques like YOLOv8 and the Segment Anything model. This repository showcases the design, implementation, and results of our system, which combines the power of aerial imagery, computer vision, and state-of-the-art algorithms to enhance crop management practices and ensure global food security.

Key Highlights:
- Utilizing the YOLOv8 model, we have efficiently detected and localized defects in plant leaves by generating accurate bounding box coordinates around the affected regions.
- Leveraging the bounding box coordinates obtained from YOLOv8, we have seamlessly integrated the Segment Anything model to create precise masks, enabling us to isolate the diseased portions of the leaves with unprecedented accuracy.

Our Approach:
1. YOLOv8: We trained the YOLOv8 model on annotated aerial images of crops, enabling it to identify various types of plant diseases with exceptional speed and precision.
2. Segment Anything Model: By passing the bounding box coordinates from YOLOv8, we empowered the Segment Anything model to generate fine-grained masks, providing a detailed segmentation of the disease-affected areas.

Results:
Our evaluation using real-world aerial images of crops demonstrates the superiority of our approach compared to traditional disease detection methods. The integration of YOLOv8 and the Segment Anything model showcases a promising path towards advancing crop management practices and ensuring food security on a global scale.

Feel free to explore the code, documentation, and results presented in this repository. We believe our work can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, agriculturalists, and technology enthusiasts alike. We encourage community feedback and collaboration to further refine and expand the capabilities of our system, ultimately contributing to the sustainable growth of agriculture worldwide. Together, let's create a positive impact on our planet's future through innovative agricultural technology.
